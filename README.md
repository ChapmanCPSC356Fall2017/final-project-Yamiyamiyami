Final Project Soundboard:
When entered the user is presented with buttons in a recycle view each containing sounds. When pressed the audio will play until completion,
on second click of the same button it will replay the audio like most soundboards I found online. The app has an add audio option in the top right
corner in the menu bar. When clicked the fragment changes and the user is showed 2 buttons. One for starting/stopping recording, and one for playing 
audio back. Since my main focus was the audio playing and recording aspect of the project I didn't maintain any persistence with the recorded audio 
as it is stored in the cache it will be deleted on back button press. 

My two takeaways is the knowledge of coding and manipulating MediaPlayers, RecyclerViews, and MediaRecorders. With the help from StackOverflow
and the Android Studio Documentation. As well as Rao Hamza for lending me his phone to test out audio recording.

****The app can only be tested on an android device and not the emulator as it doesn't support audio recording and user must allow permission
mic to be used.
